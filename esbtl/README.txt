A C++ header-only library for easy structural biology computations and geometric constructions

ESBTL (Easy Structural Biology Template Library) is a lightweight C++ library that allows the handling of PDB data and provides a data structure suitable for geometric analysis and advanced constructions. The parser and data model provided by this ready-to-use header-only library allows adequate treatment of usually discarded information (insertion codes, atom occupancy...) while still being able to detect badly formatted files. The template-based structure allows rapid design of new computational structural biology applications and is fully compatible with the new remediated PDB archive format. It also allows the code to be easy-to-use while being versatile enough to allow advanced user developments. 

ESBTL is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://esbtl.sf.net. The website provides the source code, examples, code snippets and documentation.
